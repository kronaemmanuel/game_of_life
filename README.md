# Game of Life

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using [p5 javascript library](https://p5js.org/). This is part of small, fun experiments that I do when I'm bored. I've started documenting these on my website. You can read the blogpost about this experiment [here](https://www.kronaemmanuel.com/2021/09/03/making-game-of-life.html).
